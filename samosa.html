        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour with a pinch of salt and enough water to make a stiff dough. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. Add chopped onions, green chilies, and ginger. Saut√© until onions turn translucent.</li>
        <li>Add crushed coriander seeds, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add mashed potatoes and green peas. Mix until well combined. Cook for 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into equal-sized balls. Roll out each ball into a small circle.</li>
        <li>Cut each circle in half. Take one half and fold it into a cone shape. Seal the edges using water.</li>
        <li>Fill the cone with the potato mixture. Seal the top of the cone by pressing the edges together.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process for the remaining dough and filling.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan. Fry the samosas until golden brown and crispy.</li>
